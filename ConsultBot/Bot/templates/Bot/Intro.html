        <h1>Aberdeen F.C. Kingsford Stadium Proposal</h1>
        <p>
            The proposal from Aberdeen F.C. concerning the new stadium and facilities at Kingsford is a divisive topic. As such it would be beneficial for people to be able to discuss their concerns with a member of the local council, however someone might not always be avaliable.
            This Chatbot is designed to take the place of the council member and listen to the concerns you might have regarding the stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
            As this Chatbot is currently under development it is only able to discuss concerns relating to the cost and the location of the stadium. In future it will be able to understand much more. For the moment it works best if you use short sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are ready to interact with the Chatbot please click Continue.
